= Wiki Code =

== Inline Formatting ==

=== Styles ===

For consistency, almost all wiki code is accomplished by doubling up characters. This removes the confusion in most wiki markup code where some items are doubled and some are single. This also removes the parsing problems for many edge cases like `*` being the start of a bullet or the bolding of a few characters (e.g. this is present in Google code markup).

{{{
**bold**
''Italic''
__underline__
~~strike~~
``code``
^^superscript^^
,,subscript,,
}}}

=== Links ===

Anything in double square brackets is made into a link

{{{
[[linkToWikiPage]]
[[www.google.com]]
[[Google|www.google.com]]
}}}

Some things that look like links are automatically converted to links

{{{
http://www.google.com/
user@email.com
}}}

You can link to place in a page by placing them in double-hashes (#). "top" is always reserved for the top of the page. Headings are automatically converted into internal link destinations.

{{{
##top## returns user to top
!My Heading
##My Heading## jumps user to the "My Heading" heading.
##my heading## is case insensitive for ease of use.
}}}

=== Special Objects ===

{{{
$$contents$$
$$whatsnew$$
}}}

=== Images ===

== Line Based Formatting ==

These types of formatting are based on the first characters that are present on a line. In most cases, it looks for the first character on a line with the exception of bullets which are the first two characters (a symbol and then a space).

=== Headings ===

I like the ! (bang) style headings because they are easy to type and fairly easy to read. You don't have problems like matching beginning == with ending ones. You also don't have the problem with underline versions where you need to adjust the length of the underlines when you change the heading. Strictly speaking you don't have to but it just looks and feels wrong.

{{{
!Heading Level 1
!!Heading Level 2
!!!Heading Level 3
}}}

=== Bullets ===

{{{
* Normal
* Bullets

# Numbered
# Bullets
}}}

=== Tables ===

{{{
|description|price|quantity|total|
|T-shirt|5.00|2|25.00|
|Socks|1.00|2|2.00|
|Total|||27.00|
}}}

=== Dividers ===

A single dash or a line with only dashes will convert into an <hr> divider.

{{{

}}}

== Writing the Parser ==

The nice thing about these rules is they tend not to overlap. When writing the parser, one should do all the line based parsing first.
