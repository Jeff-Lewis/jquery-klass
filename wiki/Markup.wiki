=Caffeine - Go Markup Bullets=

Approaches to parsing nested markup like bullets, numbered lists and indented code.

==Nested Grammar==

  # Use a itemize_regex to convert code into individual items.
  # Use a depth_regex to find depth of each item
  # Use a nest_html to determine the nesting html (e.g. "&lt;ul&gt;$1&lt;/ul&gt;"
  # Use a item_html to determine the item html (e.g. "&lt;li&gt;$1&lt;/li&gt;"

Weaknesses

  * Need two grammars
  * Can't handle different bullets

==Reparse==

{{{
* bullet
* same level
  * optional spaces okay
* hanging lines
  are okay
** indent
**** multi-level indent
*** outdent
* multi-level outdent
}}}

  # Use a regexp to capture and parse one indent level at a time.
  # The problem is that this requires the date in a multiple match. e.g. {{{(<=\n)([*] (.*))*}}}
  # We want the second match to return ALL of the sub-matches but it only returns the last one
