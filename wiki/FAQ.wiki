#summary Frequently Asked Questions

= Klass FAQ =

*Q. Why is the plugin called "klass" with a "k" instead of a "c"?*

"class" is a reserved word in !JavaScript. Same as why the CSS "class" property is named "className" in Javascript.

*Q. Why do you have a method named "supe". Wouldn't super have been better?*

Unfortunately, "super" is also a reserved word. My next choice would have been "parent" but this is used by the "DOM API" to refer to the "parent" of a frame.

*Q. Why did you write yet another implementation of class?*

(a) Because there wasn't a good implementation of a class plugin for jQuery that I could find (b) I wanted to guarantee there would be at least one good class plugin for jQuery I can use for my team's development of extendable classes and (c) I really wanted to contribute in an important way to the jQuery community. I have hope that this or a derivative will make it into core.

*Q. Who is the author?*

My name is Sunny Hirai, and I'm the President of with.us and the Chief Executive Office of !MeZine, the developers of !CityMax, one of the most popular website builders on the Internet. I wrote the code that !CityMax rests upon (though it has been taken over long ago) and am building the Ruby-based framework we are developing our with.us projects on.
