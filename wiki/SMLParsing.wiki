#summary Step by step how to parse an SML file

== Inline: Style Parsing ==

* The lines in an SML file should be broken up into an array with one line per array entry
* Inline parsing cannot break through lines. The reason is that (a) this is rare (b) it is easy to produce invalid html from such cases and (c) they cause a lot of edge case problems with the line based parsing (e.g. bullets, headings, etc.).
* Should be able to do most of it with a single regex
